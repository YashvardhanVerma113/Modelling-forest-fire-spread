# Modelling-forest-fire-spread
Spread of forest fires are a persistent threat and are a tough challenge for organisations both private and government to manage. This project aims to create real time simulation and modelling of such fire spread considering factors like weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind), terrain (slope, aspect, fuel availability), human activity in the Uttrakhand Area.

This project aims to create a per pixel probability that a 30m grid cell will have a fire tomorrow with a binary map + probabillities. As well as a simulation that, given ignitions in high risk areas, propagates the fire for 1/2/3/6/12 h modulated by wind, slope aspect, and fuels.
