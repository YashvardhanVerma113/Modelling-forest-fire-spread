# Modelling-forest-fire-spread
Spread of forest fires are a persistent threat and are a tough challenge for organisations both private and government to manage. This project aims to create real time simulation and modelling of such fire spread considering factors like weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind), terrain (slope, aspect, fuel availability), human activity.
